# Assignment 6 — Capstone: Deploy Book Review App (Three-Tier Architecture) on Azure

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

This is the most important assignment of the course. You will deploy the Book Review App in a production-ready, best-practice-compliant three-tier architecture on Azure: separated presentation, application, and database tiers, least-privilege network access, a controlled public entry point, protected secrets, and availability/monitoring evidence.

---

# Task 1 — Design the Azure Three-Tier Architecture

## Goal

Create an architecture diagram and implementation plan identifying the presentation, application, and database components, the chosen Azure services, the public entry point, and the internal traffic paths.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Architecture diagram showing the public entry point, three tiers, network boundaries, and traffic flow

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Written architecture assumptions and selected Azure services

![Architecture Assumptions](screenshots/assignment-06-screenshot-02-architecture-assumptions.png)

---

# Task 2 — Create the Azure Network Foundation

## Goal

Create a dedicated Resource Group and VNet with separate subnets for the web, application, and database tiers, keeping the application and database tiers without direct public access.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Resource Group overview showing the assignment resources

---

#### Screenshot 4 — VNet overview showing the address space and all required subnets

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Route-table or Private DNS evidence where applicable

---

# Task 3 — Configure Security and Secret Management

## Goal

Apply least-privilege NSG rules so traffic flows Internet → public entry point → web tier → application tier → database tier, and store credentials in Azure Key Vault or another approved secure mechanism.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — NSG rules proving least-privilege access between the tiers

![NSG Rules](screenshots/assignment-06-screenshot-06-nsg-rules.png)

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Key Vault or approved secret-management configuration (without displaying secret values)

---

# Task 4 — Deploy the Presentation (Web) Tier

## Goal

Deploy the Book Review App presentation layer on the approved web-tier compute service, configured to route requests to the internal application-tier endpoint, and not directly exposed except through the public entry service.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Web-tier compute overview showing subnet and availability configuration

---

#### Screenshot 9 — Terminal or service output proving the presentation layer is running

### Screenshot 09 — Web Tier Running

---

# Task 5 — Deploy the Business (Application) Tier

## Goal

Deploy the Book Review App backend privately in the application subnet, configured to use the private database endpoint and secured environment values, reachable only through its internal endpoint.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 10 — Application-tier compute overview showing private subnet placement

![App Tier](screenshots/assignment-06-screenshot-10-app-tier.png)

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Backend process, service, or listening-port evidence

![Backend Running](screenshots/assignment-06-screenshot-11-backend-running.png)

---

#### Screenshot 12 — Internal health-check or API response (without exposing secrets)

![Internal Health Check](screenshots/assignment-06-screenshot-12-internal-health-check.png)

---

# Task 6 — Deploy the Managed Database Tier

## Goal

Create a private Azure managed database (public access disabled), with availability/backup/retention settings, the Book Review App schema imported, and access restricted to the application tier only.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 13 — Database overview showing private connectivity and public access disabled

![Database Private Networking](screenshots/assignment-06-screenshot-13-database-private.png)

---

#### Screenshot 14 — Availability, backup, and retention configuration

![Database Backups](screenshots/assignment-06-screenshot-14-database-backups.png)


---

#### Screenshot 15 — Successful schema or connectivity verification (without exposing credentials)

![Database Schema](screenshots/assignment-06-screenshot-15-database-schema.png)

---

# Task 7 — Configure Traffic Management, Availability, and Monitoring

## Goal

Configure the approved public entry service with health probes and backend pools, internal routing for the application tier where required, and enable Azure Monitor/diagnostics/logs/alerts for the key resources.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 16 — Public entry service showing listener, frontend endpoint, and healthy web targets

![Public Entry and Healthy Backend](screenshots/assignment-06-screenshot-16-public-entry-healthy.png)
---

#### Screenshot 17 — Internal application-tier load-balancing or routing configuration where applicable

![Internal App Routing](screenshots/assignment-06-screenshot-17-internal-app-routing.png)

---

#### Screenshot 18 — Azure Monitor, diagnostic settings, logs, metrics, or alert evidence

![Monitoring Metrics](screenshots/assignment-06-screenshot-18-monitoring-metrics.png)

---

# Task 8 — Validate the Production-Style Deployment

## Goal

Confirm the Book Review App works end to end through the public endpoint, with at least one database read and one write, confirm private tiers are not internet-reachable, and complete a safe availability test.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 19 — Browser showing the Book Review App through the public endpoint

![Public Application](screenshots/assignment-06-screenshot-19-public-app.png)

---

#### Screenshot 20 — Proof of successful database-backed read and write operations

![Database Data](screenshots/assignment-06-screenshot-20-database-data.png)

---

#### Screenshot 21 — Evidence that private tiers are not publicly accessible

![End-to-End Test](screenshots/assignment-06-screenshot-21-end-to-end.png)

---

#### Screenshot 22 — Availability-test and healthy-target evidence
